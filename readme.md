## 👋 Well hello there 🤖

I mostly play around with Android development here but I'm an iOS developer by trade, so there's also some swift scattered throughout my repos.

I treat each new app as an opportunity to play around with a different framework/design pattern/etc.

#### I'm currently working on
- 🛰 &nbsp; Experimenting with kotlin/swift libraries for [basic-remote-configs](https://github.com/BradPatras/basic-remote-configs)
- 🛠 &nbsp; Building [bike-omaha](https://github.com/BradPatras/bike-omaha/) (On hold)
- 🏋️ &nbsp; Maintaining [gpx-recorder](https://github.com/BradPatras/gpx-recorder)

&nbsp;

✅ &nbsp; My most feature-complete app is [GPX Recorder](https://github.com/bradpatras/gpx-recorder).  

💎 &nbsp; My prettiest looking app is [todometer](https://github.com/bradpatras/todometer-android). <sup>*Because the design came from an [already existing](https://github.com/cassidoo/todometer) app that I just adapted to the mobile experience 😅 </sup>
