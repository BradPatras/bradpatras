## 👋 &nbsp; Brad is my name and making super-niche, single-screen, only-useful-to-me Android apps is my game 🤓

Funnily enough I'm actually an iOS developer by trade, so don't be surprised if you see some swift scattered throughout my repos (like how I'm using swift as a scripting language to build my statically-hosted json files for my bike-omaha Android app. [Check it out](https://github.com/BradPatras/bike-omaha/tree/master/services))

I treat each new app as an opportunity to play around with a different framework/design practice/etc.

**I'm currently working on**
- 🛠 &nbsp; Building [bike-omaha](https://github.com/BradPatras/bike-omaha/)
- ⤴️ &nbsp; Updating [todometer](https://github.com/BradPatras/todometer-android) to V2
- 🏋️ &nbsp; Maintaining [gpx-recorder](https://github.com/BradPatras/gpx-recorder)

&nbsp;

✅ &nbsp; My most feature-complete app is [GPX Recorder](https://github.com/bradpatras/gpx-recorder).  

💎 &nbsp; My prettiest looking app is [todometer](https://github.com/bradpatras/todometer-android). <sup>*Because the design came from an [already existing](https://github.com/cassidoo/todometer) app that I just adapted to the mobile experience 😅 </sup>
